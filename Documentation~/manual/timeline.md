# Timeline
This section covers general timeline integration, and how you can create your own animations using timeline.

This is only relevant if you have installed Unity's [official timeline package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@1.2/manual/index.html). 
If you haven't, you can ignore this section.
