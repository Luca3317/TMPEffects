# Creating animations
There are multiple ways to create animations in TMPEffects.

- [Through a custom script](creatinganimations_script.md)
- [Through the inspector](genericanimations.md)
- [Using Unity's timeline](timeline_creatinganimations.md)

I recommend reading the documentation for the script version, even if you intend to only use timeline or the inspector.  
Its helpful to understand roughly how it works, and its actually quite quick and easy to create your own animations this way!
