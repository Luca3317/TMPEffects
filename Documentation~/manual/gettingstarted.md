# Getting Started

## Install required packages
First, you will need to install TextMeshPro. Generally, newer (post 2018) versions of Unity have TextMeshPro installed by default.  
Second, you will of course also have to install TMPEffects itself -- see the [following section](installation.md) for that.  

While not required, I also recommend to install Unity's [Timeline package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@1.2/manual/index.html) to allow you to make use of TMPEffects' visual animation creation (if you do intend on making your own animations).

## Example Scene
When installing TMPEffects, you'll get the option to import the Example Scene.  
It'll give you an overview of TMPEffects right in the Unity inspector, although this documentation of course includes all that info and more.

## Components
The chapters on [TMPAnimator](tmpanimator_gettingstarted.md) and [TMPWriter](tmpwriter_gettingstarted.md) each start with a quick-start for the respective component.
